Control board for ventilator 
# Open Source Ventilator
## ESP32 based ventilator board
* Control board for an open source respiratory assist device for covid pandemic assistance. 
### Objectives
* Control a wiper motor based on PID control system based on the volume intake value and peep pressure required
* Board should display the peep pressure value,volume flow rate in an LCD dsiplay
* Board should also have wifi access to share the patients details in different beds(hospitals) to a common network, so that medical personnels could monitor their conditions real time
* Correct the issues that will surely occur in version 1.
### Version 1 Board
* As always jumper wires hanging here and there,as part of errors & corrections. But efforts were not wasted. Finally one awkward looking working board :)
